# ml-graph-challenge

This repository implements a solution for a challenge focusing on interpreting, analyzing, describing, modeling and traning data for the porpuse of generate preditions on the contamination rate between individuals.

### Instructions

The code is build in python 3.8.1. So, in order to fully replicate this repository you need to have python 3.8.1 or higher settled in your machine. If you need help to do so, I recommend check [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/) where you can install multiple python versions and set a virtaul environment. I ran the following commands:

```
pyenv install 3.8.1
```

```
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.1 [env_name]
```

Once the environment is settled, make sure your pip is upgraded:

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

Then, install the libraries pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and Jupyter Notebook:

```
pip3 install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter notebook plotly
```
